Hi! Thank you for visiting my website!

This website is mostly for blog posts.
The posts here are for myself to remember things.
Each post might be nothing special. Similar ones can be found elsewhere.
Writing by my own words helps me to understand things and shape ideas better.

The update is random. When Iâ€™m impressed by something, I write a new post.

This website is created by [jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and
[Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) using
[tailwindcss-ruby gem](https://github.com/flavorjones/tailwindcss-ruby).
The website code is pushed to the GitHub repository: [frosted-pebble
](https://github.com/yokolet/frosted-pebble).
Please visit the repo also!
