This project is Natural Language Processing, one of Deep Learning applications.
Jane means an acclaimed British novelist, Jane Austen.
Her famous novels, Pride and Prejudice, Sense and Sensibility and Emma, are the training data.
Entire three novels were fed to a Deep Leaning model to learn word to word sequences.
After the training and model tuning were performed enough,
Jane's novel-like sentences were generated given the first key word.

Details about the project is put together in the PDF file,
[Report.pdf](https://github.com/yokolet/DeepLearning/blob/master/Jane/Report.pdf).

For this project, NLP model was designed to handle Jane Austen novels well using
TensorFlow.
