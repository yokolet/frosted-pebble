A well-known snake game implementation by C++.
The project was created to study C++.
As a tweak, the app has two snakes; one moves by manual input, another moves automatically,
optimally, to find a food quickly.
The app has one more tweak of a toxic food. The toxic food appears randomly.
When a snake hits the toxic food, snake's length is cut down.
